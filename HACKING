CODESTYLE
1. Indent with 2 spaces, not tabs
2. For comments use only /**/         
3. Use only snake_case
4. Code Blocks:
  4.1. "{" in a func definition is on the new line
  4.2. "{" in the other blocks (loops, if/else, etc) is on the same line, separated by one space
  4.3. "else"/"else if" blocks start on the same line as the "}" of the previous "if"
  4.4. New variables declarations/definitions is at top of the block
  4.5. Function-like macros blocks must not exceed 5 lines of code; if they are longer, than function must be used instead 

program example in such a style:
int main(void)
{
  /* main func vars: */
  int var3;
  char var1 = 13, var2 = 37;

  if(var1 == var2) {
    var3 = 0xdead;
  } else {
    var3 = 0xbeef;
  }

  return 0;
}
